# Prompt Engineering and the Interview Pattern 

What is the Interview Pattern Approach?

The interview pattern approach is like having a conversation with the AI. 

Instead of just giving it one prompt, you ask questions back and forth, like an interview. 

This way, the AI can understand exactly what you need and give better answers.

How Does It Work?
Give Clear Instructions: Start by telling the AI exactly what you want it to do. For example, ask it to pretend to be a travel expert.

Ask Follow-Up Questions: The AI will ask you questions to get more information. The more details you give, the better the answer will be.

Go Back and Forth: You keep answering the AI's questions until it has all the info it needs to give you a great answer.

Detailed Interaction: This back-and-forth chat helps the AI understand and give better responses in real time.

# "You are a travel expert. Please help me plan a trip by asking me detailed questions one by one." 

AI's Follow-Up Questions:

What kind of places do you like to visit?
Can you tell me what activities you enjoy on vacation?
How do you usually plan your trips?
Do you like learning about history or different cultures when you travel?
What kind of places do you like to stay at, like hotels or campsites?
How much do you want to spend on this trip?

As I answer each question, the AI learns more about what I want and can plan a trip that’s just right for me.

# Benefits of the Interview Pattern Approach

Interactive and Flexible: This method is more interactive than just giving one prompt. It’s like having a real conversation.
Real-Time Understanding: The AI can ask questions to make sure it understands exactly what you need.
